Create an API that accepts a url path to a video file. The API must examine the video and return the following data about the video in the specified json format provided.

    File name
    Duration
    List of video streams and specified details
    List of audio streams and specified details
    List of caption streams and specified details

Some mp4 files have been provided to help with testing.

The API can be developed using any technology stack you feel comfortable working with. You may use 3rd party tools, such as FFmpeg or libav, to extract data from the source or for any part of the application you deem it fit. The application must be hosted on an online repository of your choice. Pleases make this repository accessible for review.
